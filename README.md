P1: DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS 

a. Write an program to find basic descriptive statistics using summary, str, quartile function on mtcars& 

cars datasets. 

b. Write an program to find subset of dataset by using 

subset (), aggregate () functions on iris dataset. 

P2: READING AND WRITING DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATASETS 

a. Reading different types of data sets (.txt, .csv) from Web and disk and writing in file in 

specific disk location. 

b. Reading Excel data sheet in Python. 

P3: VISUALIZATIONS

a. Find the data distributions using box and scatter plot. b. Find the outliers using plot. c. Plot the 

histogram, bar chart and pie chart on sample data. 

P4: CORRELATION AND COVARIANCE 

a. Find the correlation matrix. 

b. Plot the correlation plot on dataset and visualize giving an overview of relationships 

among data on iris data. 

c. Analysis of covariance: variance (ANOVA), if data have categorical variables on iris data. 

P5: REGRESSION MODEL Import a data from web storage. Name the dataset and now do Logistic 

Regression to find out relation between variables that are affecting the admission of a student in a institute 

based on his or her GRE score, GPA obtained and rank of the student. Also check the model is fit or not. 

Require (foreign), require (MASS). 

P6: MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODEL 

Apply multiple regressions, if data have a continuous Independent variable. Apply on above dataset. 

P7: CLASSIFICATION MODEL 

a. Install relevant package for classification. 

b. Choose classifier for classification problem. 

c. Evaluate the performance of classifier. 

P8: CLUSTERING MODEL 

a. Clustering algorithms for unsupervised classification. 

b. Plot the cluster data using matplotlib visualizations. 

P9: Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. 

Print both correct and incorrect predictions.
